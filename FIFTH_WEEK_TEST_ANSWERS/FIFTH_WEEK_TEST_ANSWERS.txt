3. Pregunta 3
Which of the following statements are true about the following binary search tree? Select all that apply.

RESPUESTA:
- 32 must have been inserted before 12.
- A different insertion order with the same values could give a different tree structure.

4. Pregunta 4
Which of the following statements are true about the running time of binary search trees? Assume that when we use big-O notation we mean the tightest big-O bound. Select all that apply.

RESPUESTA INCORRECTA:
- The tightest possible worst case time to find an element in an arbitrary BST is O(n)
- Inserting sorted data into an unbalanced [...]

RESPUESTA INCORRECTA:
- The tightest possible worst case time to find an element in an arbitrary BST is O(n)
- The tightest possible worst case time to find an element in a balanced BST is log(n)

RESPUESTA:
- The tightest possible worst case time to find an element in an arbitrary BST is O(n) (Correct)
- The tightest possible worst case time to find an element in a balanced BST is O(log(n)) (Correct)
- Inserting sorted data into an unbalanced BST leads to the worst case BST structure (i.e. a structure where finding an element will take the longest). (Correct)

From your benchmarking of the DictionaryLL and DictionaryBST structures you implemented, which structure is the better choice?

RESPUESTA:
DictionaryBST


6. Pregunta 6

In your benchmarking of the DictionaryBST structure, you probably found that the time to find words did not significantly increase as the Dictionary got larger.

We were measuring the best case performance of the dictionary [...]

RESPUESTA:
- log(n) is sufficiently small and grows [...]
